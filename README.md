<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src=https://nesninja.com/public/images/nes/found/Kirby%27s_Adventure_1.png>

Here's why:
* "Kirby's Adventure" is an easy to understand and fun to play game, that's why it was one of the first games that I thought of when choosing a game.
* Kirby's cute and friendly looking appearance makes  him one of my favorite Nintendo characters.
* One of my best friends is the biggest Kirby fan I know, so I couldn't not choose a Kirby game.

## My version

This section gives a clear and detailed overview of which parts of the original game I planned to make.

### The minimum I will most certainly develop:
* Kirby's basic mechanics
* The first level of the game
* Different types of enemies, as found in level 1
* Power-Ups for Kirby

### What I will probably make as well:
* Particle effects for all the different actions in the game
* Loading screens and menus
* The level-hub as seen in the original game

### What I plan to create if I have enough time left:
* The jump pad mini game, accessed when completing a level, used to gain bonus score or extra lives
* More levels
* More enemies and power-ups for Kirby
* The small 'boss-fight' found in level 2
